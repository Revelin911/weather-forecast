# Weather-Forecast

## Description

This project is helping understand the concepts of working with API's. The reason behind this is to get some practice working with the front end and the back end. Making these two work together properly will help the user retrieve data appropriately. This project helps usability for user when they are searching for the weather forecast in a specific city. I was able to learn how to try to tie the front end and the back end together. Without the proper information of either, the app would not work appropriately for the user. It helped me get more practice in to work each method appropriately and reading and udnerstanding what eahc method is doing.
